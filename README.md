# Analysis regarding work by Rodriguez-Romaguera, Ung, Nomura et al.

Files contain imaging and sequencing analysis pertaining to our project.

Calcium imaging and behavioral analysis requires Python and R. We used the [Anaconda distribution of Python 3](https://www.anaconda.com/) and performed analysis within Jupyter Notebook. rpy2 enables execution of R code in the same notebook.

Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis is provided as a Jupyter Notebook. Code can alternatively be copied into a script or IDE for execution. All steps of the analysis can be completed with the preprocessed data deposited on NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus accession no. GSE132067
